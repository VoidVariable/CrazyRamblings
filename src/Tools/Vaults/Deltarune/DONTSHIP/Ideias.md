Some ramblings Im thinking about before turning off

Ralsei could be to Kris what Queen is to Noelle. (And maybe Lancer to Susie)

In the chapters we have seen, there's seems to be a pattern where 1 darkworld will relate to a specfic character (1 - Susie, 2 - Noelle). It's hard to say if this is something that will create a pattern -- there's really 3 lightners we know are important (Kris, Noelle and Susie) and we already seen the chapter of 2 of the members -- Are we going to have a funcking jockington darlworld? Maybe we will go into Toriel/Asgore or even Dess -- at least that's more believable.

But in any case. I think it's clear Queen's obsession with Noelle is related to Noelles relationship with her mother, need to research exactly how much this is apparent. 

So my ideia is that Ralsei being Asriel is something like that...? Just a narative device to handle the struggles of Kris as a character.
